# The Sanitizing Shop

This is an e-commerce app that I built using React.js. Due to the [2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), products such as Hand Sanitizer, Wet Wipes, and Face Masks have been in high demand, so I thought I would "open" my "own" Sanitizing Shop.

It is deployed on Heroku, at https://the-sanitizing-shop.herokuapp.com/.

The corresponding backend of the app is also hosted on Heroku. Its corresponding Github repository can be found here: https://github.com/michaelmamuric/the-sanitizing-shop-backend

Some of the technologies and websites I used for this project:
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.
- [Redux Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist) to persist Redux state in local storage.
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to easily create React UI components.
- [Free Logo Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) to design the logo of my "own shop"
- [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) for dates formatting
- [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/) for number formatting
- [validator.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) for form validation
